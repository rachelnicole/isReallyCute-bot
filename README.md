# IsReallyCute

This bot tells new followers how cute they are, and also compliments people when they talk to it.

# ~Learning~

The base for this bot is from Darius Kazemi's example bot https://github.com/dariusk/examplebot

I also used resources found on http://botpad.org/p/bot_resources to find out more about how twitter streams work.

Following the instructions on Darius' example bot, it tells you to use the npm package called twit, which you can find here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit

It tells you a lot of information about what you can access for twitter streams. To get more in depth, read the twitter developers documentation about their streaming apis. :) https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/userstreams


Bot is still in alpha so it's pretty buggy / ugly but I want to improve on it.
